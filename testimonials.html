            <p>It was an absolute pleasure to work with Yaël! She supported us on a high profile project, working to tight deadlines. She has the ability to quickly understand exactly what the requirements are, she asks all the right questions and is able to create clear user flows even in complex and challenging scenarios. She is a real professional with great UX knowledge and experience – and great personality!</p>

          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Yaël was a great addition to the UX team at JustGiving. She cares passionately about the user and ensures that they are at the heart of all conversations with designers, developers and product managers. Yaël has demonstrated a great attention for detail when it comes to defining requirements, exploring concepts and creating wireframes at various levels of fidelity. She is a great team player and her collaborative approach in a fast-moving, agile based product team was well received by the people she worked with.</p>
            <small>Will Hardy, UX Designer, JustGiving</small>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Yaël was a delight to work with. She's a clear, strategic thinker who is very knowlegable when it comes to user-experience design. Within only a couple of days she managed to deliver tip-top results so I would definitely hire her again!</p>
            <small>Sarah Parker, Story Worldwide</small>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Managing Yaël was an absolute pleasure. She's bright, enthusiastic and pro-active. Every task she was given she attacked thoroughly and quickly. She worked well with the rest of the team, inspiring them and pushing them and worked on solo projects with the same professionalism. Great quality of work and great attitude.</p>
            <small>Ben Geliher, Lead Producer, Mind Candy</small>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Yaël is not only a great team player and an extremely talented UX designer but generally a lot of fun to be around with. I enjoyed working with her improving the UX experience at Moshi Monsters and developing interfaces for new features. I can whole heartily recommend her and wish her the best for any future endeavours.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Yaël brought a lot of much needed UX focus to our team when she joined the company. Pragmatic and eager, she's excellent at bringing aspects of a product into focus and catching the details that make the difference between an average product and a great one. Very personable and good in a discussion, and always open with the reasoning behind UX suggestions and direction which, from a developers perspective, makes her very valuable and easy to work with. While working together, Yaël embraced agile and worked in step with out development resulting in much improved version 1 products and helped our development team become much more sensitive to UX.</p>
            <small>David Whitney, Senior Software Developer, JustGiving</small>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>I'm truly going to miss working with Yaël. She has turned her bright, friendly personality into her greatest asset as a User experience designer: her ability to communicate with anyone in the business, from developers to fellow designers to the leadership team is amazing. A talent for engaging people works with users too, giving her the empathy necessary for great user research. Yaël combines this with a strong instinct for design and usability, and a very collaborative approach to work. She is an asset to any business and to the UX community. I hope our careers cross paths again!</p>

            <p>Yaël is a talented user experience designer, I’ve worked with her on several projects whilst at JustGiving and each time she has been a pleasure to work with. Yaël has excellent communication skills, is very approachable with bags of enthusiasm and is an asset to any team. She brings with her the most amazing personality; she is bubbly & friendly and great fun to work with. I’ll miss working with her a great deal.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>I really enjoy working with Yaël. She is a real team player, making sure that the right people are involved in a project and kept up-to-date with developments. She is great at explaining the reasons behind her decisions, which are always user-focused and logical. Yaël has taught me a lot about UX, and works hard to make the Agile process work for all involved. She is really passionate about her job, and keen to learn from others too. She listens to other opinions, questions why decisions have been made, and works collaboratively to make sure the best outcome is reached for the user. On top of her professional strengths, Yaël is a lot of fun to work with. She doesn’t take herself too seriously and always has a smile on her face.</p>
