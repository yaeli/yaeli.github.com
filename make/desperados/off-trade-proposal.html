            <span class="label">The Challenge</span>
            <p>Desperados were looking for a clever way to encourage people to enter their competition in-store, across Europe. We were pitching our vision for how the competition worked, what people would see in-store, how they would be persuaded to enter the competition online, and what that online experience would be.</p>
            <p>Key considerations for Desperados were for the competition to be tightly bound to their brand and ethos, for a super-simple yet exciting online experience, and a way for the competition to spread to friends.</p>

          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label">What I Did</span>
            <p>When I joined the project, there was already a clear idea in place for what the in-store experience would be and how people would be drawn into the Desperados stands in-store.</p>
            <p>My role at this stage was mainly to visualise how this in-store customer journey would extend into the digital journey, and present this in a compelling way for inclusion into the pitch.</p>
            <p>Based on demographic data and some research already gathered about the target customers, I created a storyboard of how the customer journey would flow, starting from entering the supermarket all the way through to entering the competition.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>My sketches for use in my storyboard</p></span>
            <p>The storyboard included a visual representation of the 'Jamie' buying his beer, as well as icon denoting his level of delight and engagement with the brand. I also included a brief excerpt of his likely motivations at each stage.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>A part of the finished storyboard</p></span>
            <p>I then started focusing in on the detail of the digital part of the journey. Working closely with the developer on the team for this project, we came up some ideas for how to create super simple competition entry with a twist of excitement, to encourage promotion of the competition to friends.</p>
            <p>Creating sketches only at this stage, we iterated through a number of ideas with the rest of the team, and in consultation with the client, finally landed on an idea that was within budget, and that ticked all the right boxes.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Sketching ideas.</p></span>
            <p>I then worked up some more detailed user flows to cover the different types of users that would be interacting with this - the initial customer and the friend's of the customer - as well as looking at the journeys via mobile, desktop and using QR codes. These journeys were then interrogated by the developer to create a tech spec for the pitch, and also was integral in making sure that the user flows were feasible and within budget.</p>

            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>User flows.</p></span>
            <p>Finally, some higher fidelity wireframes were created for a final review with the team, and to present to the client. I worked up the mobile journey as this was the main focus - many Desperados customers were engaging with the brand through their mobile devices, as well as being able to enter the competition easily on the go being important.</p>
