            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>Ernst and Young's current brand book focused heavily on print and didn't really touch on how to bring their brand into digital spheres.</p>
            <p>Our challenge was to undertake a comprehensive review of all the Ernst & Young digital channels and to provide a solid set of recommendations for how their brand should be implemented digitally, which would then feed into their brand book.</p>
            <p>From the start, it was clear from the client's direction that this was not an opportunity for a massive redesign of their current digital offering. It was also not an opportunity to revamp information architecture or page templates.</p>
            <p>The challenge instead was to review their current digital channels and provide recommendations for how to optimise what they currently had, focusing on creating visual design rules that could better bring out their brand digitally. These rules were then to be documented in digital chapters of their brand book.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>Working closely with the visual designer, we were initially tasked with creating 3 deliverables:</p>
            <ol class="list">
              <li>Competitor review</li>
              <li>An UX and design review of the EY current digital platforms - EY.com, EY micro sites, EY social channels, EY mobile apps, and EY digital ads.</li>
              <li>A review of the current EY Visual Identity Guidelines and a proposal for how to incorporate the new Digital Guidelines</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As the focus of this project was mainly on visual design tweaks, my heuristic evaluation tried to focus more on elements that could be affected by visual design, rather than delving too deeply into site functionality and architecture.</p>
            <p>I began my work by taking over a wall and covering it with screenshots of the different areas of EY that we were reviewing. I post-it noted areas of concern all over the screenshots using a set of heuristics as a guide.</p>

            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Post it notes on my screenshots with areas of concern.</p></span>
            <p>I then categorised my post-it notes into areas, which would form the basis for my key findings of problem areas across the EY digital channels.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>A draft of key findings and recommendations based in part on post-it note categorisation</p></span>
            <p>I conducted these evaluations of a number of competitor sites, EY.com itself, and a number of EY micro sites. We then synthesised my UX findings and recommendations together with the visual designer's findings and recommendations, to produce a competitor review and an EY review that combined thoughts from both a UX and design perspective.</p>
            <p>This review included an analysis of specific Ernst & Young pages that the client wanted to get feedback on:</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>A draft of one of pages included in the EY page analysis</p></span>
            <p>I also included a look at some of the best practice principles that my recommendations were based on, with accompanying examples from respected sites so that the client could see how others implemented these principles effectively in their digital channels. We also highlighted which of the EY design principles were currently not being adhered to (in the yellow boxes):</p>

            <p>As well as looking at the EY channels separately, I wanted to understand the relationship between all the elements of EY's digital channels together. I created a Channels Map which looked both across the EY digital channels and down their 4 main content categories: Insights, Industries, Services and Careers. This gave us an overview of how their content mapped across all their channels and how we might be able to standardise this visually (for example, creating a rule that photography used in Careers-based channels should be relaxed and informal).</p>

            <p>We also reviewed their current brand guidelines to understand what was missing from a digital perspective. I created a content matrix that detailed what they covered currently, and then we added in what we thought was missing from a UX and design perspective. This was to become our roadmap for how we approached creating new digital guidelines for EY going forward.</p>

            <p>We presented our findings and recommendations derived from our analyses to the client, and they were well-received. We also produced a comprehensive report detailing our research, findings and recommendations.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>The final report</p></span>
            <p>We were given the green light to proceed on to the next phase of the project which was actually crafting digital guidelines out of our recommendations, ending up with the creation of digital-focused content for the EY brand book.</p>
            <p>At this point, I handed over my work to a newly employed UX designer who was taking over the account permanently.</p>

          <div class="proj-eval">
            <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
            <p>This project was really enjoyable as I got to collaborate heavily with a visual designer - there were many points at which we had opposing points of view, for example on how we were going to treat links, but through which we were able to come to a compromise. I think our close collaboration and debates around these points will ultimately have made a much better designed, usable set of guidelines for the client to use.</p>
            <p>However, this project was also an interesting challenge in that we were heavily restricted around what we were able to affect and what we were not. A main point of contention for me was that refreshing the visual design in this way was only putting a nicer face on some deep-seated usability problems around navigation and page structure. It was definitely a test to figure out how best to broach these wider issues with the client in the context of this project, and how to try to have the maximum impact on usability with many constraints.</p>
