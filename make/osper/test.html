								        <h3>The challenge</h3>
								        <p>Osper are a young startup that provide a prepaid debit card to young people, and an accompanying mobile app for the young person and their parents, to track their spending and set savings goals.</p>
												<p>Osper needed some experienced UX support to work with their product and dev teams to get ready for launch.</p>
												<p>Key flows and screens needed designing quickly and usability testing sessions needed to be set up with young people and their parents.</p>

					        <div class="row">
					        		<div class="col-md-8">					        
												<p>As a small, agile team, it was vital that UX fit quickly and seamlessly into the development process. For each task, after some initial research and requirements gathering, design and developers would develop user stories and acceptance criteria together.</p>
												<p>Iâ€™d begin fleshing out user flows and wireframing up different solutions to the problem as discussion aids with the wider team.</p>
												<p>These initial user flows and wireframes would be iterated on through reviews with the development team, visual design and the product owner. Once they were high enough fidelity, they were attached to Trello cards so that development and visual design could begin to work from them.</p>

												<p>I also made use of tools like Flinto (best for app prototypes) or Axure (best for desktop prototypes) to test interactivity and the flow.</p>
												<p>The prototypes were also taken into usability testing with young people and parents, as well as used for internal testing by designers and developers.</p> 
												<p>I recruited participants for these testing sessions using an initial screener I had written and then pre-screening over the telephone. I ran the usability sessions with either a designer or a developer also present. All sessions were recorded so that the rest of the team could watch them later.</p>
												<p>After testing, I wrote up usability feedback using a simple traffic light system to prioritise, and had the main recommendations for changes ready for the next morning. This quickly synthesised feedback was incorporated back into the wireframes/visual designs or went straight to developers.</p>
												<p>Coming to build, with all the stories and epics written out in collaborative multi-discipline sessions already, it was easy to begin.</p>
												<p>My role at build stage was to input and guide the developers as they pushed updates to the testing environment, so I could play around with the interactions and structure actually on screen. Feedback would be given to the developers in collaborative pairing sessions so I could sit with them and work in browser. </p>
												<p>Finally, once developed, the whole team would help QA the new feature.</p>

					        <h3>The outcome</h3>
					        <p>We worked in this manner on a number of projects, most notably the registration flow for young people and parents, a flow for locking and cancelling your Osper card from within the app and getting sent your PIN from within the app.</p>
					        <p>Working in this agile and collaborative manner was great in making sure that there were no surprises within the development cycle, and that for the most part, projects ran smoothly.</p>
					        <p>It was also fantastic to be running weekly usability testing sessions for up-to-the-minute feedback from users and putting a structure in place that allowed the startup to continue with this after I'd gone.</p>
