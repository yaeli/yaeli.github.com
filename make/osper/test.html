              <h3>Project brief</h3>
              <p>I worked with Osper on a series of projects to help them get launch ready. Osper had been working hard on getting their mobile app ready for launch and they had a few areas where they wanted some UX support.</p>
              <p>I was brought in to help work on:</p>
              	<ul class="list">
              		<li><strong>Registration flows</strong> that took the prospective users from a website into the app</li>
									<li><strong>How to lock and cancel</strong> your Osper debit card from within the app</li>
									<li><strong>Ordering additional cards</strong> from within the app</li>
									<li><strong>Getting your PIN</strong> from within the app</li>
									<li>Concepts for the <strong>App homepage</strong></li>
									<li>Recruiting for and running <strong>usability testing</strong> sessions with children and parents</li>
									<li>Helping <strong>formalise the role of UX</strong> within the startup and work with the designer and developers in a highly agile environment</li>
              	</ul>

          <div class="proj-challenge">
            <h3>The challenge</h3>
            <p>Osper are a young startup that provide a prepaid debit card to young people, and an accompanying mobile app for the young person and their parents, to track their spending and set savings goals.</p>
            <p><a class="fancybox" href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3955/15415613010_1762df67cd_z.jpg"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3955/15415613010_1762df67cd_q.jpg"></a></p>

            <p>As a small product team, they had no UX representatives feeding into the product design thinking. I was brought in to help specifically with flows and features specifically related to registration and onboarding.</p> 
            <p>As the app needed both a young person and a parent to sign up, and then for both of them to download an app and set it up, there were a few variables that made registration with Osper not as straightforward as usual.</p>
            <p>There were also some other complex flows and screens relating to onboarding that needed some UX thinking, for example, how young people and/or parents could lock or cancel their prepaid debit cards from within the Osper app.</p>
            <p>Finally, another challenge was to think about how to bring in regular young people and parents for usability testing sessions.</p>

            <h3>What I did</h3>
            <p>I worked very closely with the visual designer and developers to develop user stories surrounding the above issues. Once I had got a clear idea of design and technical constraints, and as a team, we had written down some acceptance criteria, I began sketching out various solutions. These sketching sessions were done in conjunction with the visual designer, and had regular reviews by the developers to sense check.</p> 
            <p>Using Omnigraffle, Iâ€™d flesh out user flows for discussion with the wider team, as well as start to wireframe up different solutions to the problem as discussion aids</p>
            <p><a class="fancybox" href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3949/15602047242_8857f0432c_z.jpg"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3949/15602047242_8857f0432c_q.jpg"></a>

	            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Flows and wireframes</p></span> 
            <p>I also enjoyed use tools like Flinto or Axure to easily drop my wireframes into a clickable mobile prototype. This could then be accessed on a mobile phone with simulated interactions to test the flow.</p>
            <p><a class="fancybox" href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5606/14981168633_b11dd2ebe1_z.jpg"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5606/14981168633_b11dd2ebe1_q.jpg"></a></p>
	            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Axure prototype of the website application form</p></span>
	            <p><a class="fancybox" href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5604/15602212142_1012f9150d_z.jpg"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5604/15602212142_1012f9150d_q.jpg"></a></p>
	            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Flinto prototype of the mobile app (screenshot shown is of the Flinto back-end, not as would have been seen on a mobile device)</p></span>
            <p>These Flinto prototypes would then go into a round of usability testing with young people and parents, as well as internal testing by designers and developers. I recruited participants for these testing sessions using a screener I had written and pre-screening over the telephone. I then ran the usability sessions with either a designer or a developer also present. All sessions were recorded so that the rest of the team could watch them later.</p>
            <p>After testing prototypes with young people and parents, I wrote up usability feedback using a traffic light system, and had the main recommendations for changes ready for the next morning. This gathered feedback was incorporated back into my wireframes.</p>
            <p>Once I was happy with the overall flow, hierarchy and content of the screens, I worked with the visual designer to start producing high-fidelity prototypes, whilst also updating the docs with interaction notes and acceptance criteria.</p>
            <p>These high-fidelity designs would then get tested again in the next round of usability testing sessions and iterated on as per need. I made sure that the headline feedback was in front of the designer by the next morning so that we could iterate quickly. On some occasions, the designer would be with me in the session, so we could iterate in between testing sessions on the big things that we wanted to change, for truly rapid iteration.</p>
            <p>Having already included the developers in this process, with all the stories and epics written out in collaborative multi-discipline sessions already, it was an easy next step for them to start working on building the designs.</p>
            <p>My role at this stage was to input and guide the developers as they pushed updates to the testing environment, so I could play around with the interactions and structure actually on screen. Feedback would be given to the developers in collaborative pairing sessions so I could sit with them and work in browser. </p>
            <p>Finally, once developed, the whole team would help QA the new feature.</p>

          <div class="proj-outcome">
            <h3>The outcome</h3>
            <p>We worked in this manner on a number of projects, most notably the registration flow for young people and parents, a flow for locking and cancelling your Osper card from within the app and getting sent your PIN from within the app.</p>
            <p>Working in this agile and collaborative manner was great in making sure that there were no surprises within the development cycle, and that for the most part, projects ran smoothly. It was also fantastic to be running weekly usability testing sessions for up-to-the-minute feedback from users.</p>
