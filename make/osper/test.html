								        <h3>The challenge</h3>
								        <p>Osper are a young startup that provide a prepaid debit card to young people, and an accompanying mobile app for the young person and their parents, to track their spending and set savings goals.</p>
												<p>Osper needed some experienced UX support to work with their product and dev teams to get ready for launch.</p>
												<p>Key flows and screens needed designing quickly and usability testing sessions needed to be set up with young people and their parents.</p>

					        <div class="row">
					        		<div class="col-md-8">					        
												<p>As a small, agile team, it was vital that UX fit quickly and seamlessly into the development process. For each task, after some initial research and requirements gathering, design and developers would develop user stories and acceptance criteria together.</p>
												<p>Iâ€™d begin fleshing out user flows and wireframing up different solutions to the problem as discussion aids with the wider team.</p>
												<p>These initial user flows and wireframes would be iterated on through reviews with the development team, visual design and the product owner. Once they were high enough fidelity, they were attached to Trello cards so that development and visual design could begin to work from them.</p>

					        <p>I also enjoyed use tools like Flinto or Axure to easily drop my wireframes into a clickable mobile prototype. This could then be accessed on a mobile phone with simulated interactions to test the flow.</p>
					        <p><a class="fancybox" href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5606/14981168633_b11dd2ebe1_z.jpg"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5606/14981168633_b11dd2ebe1_q.jpg"></a></p>

						      <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Flinto prototype of the mobile app (screenshot shown is of the Flinto back-end, not as would have been seen on a mobile device)</p></span>
					        <p>These Flinto prototypes would then go into a round of usability testing with young people and parents, as well as internal testing by designers and developers. I recruited participants for these testing sessions using a screener I had written and pre-screening over the telephone. I then ran the usability sessions with either a designer or a developer also present. All sessions were recorded so that the rest of the team could watch them later.</p>
					        <p>After testing prototypes with young people and parents, I wrote up usability feedback using a traffic light system, and had the main recommendations for changes ready for the next morning. This gathered feedback was incorporated back into my wireframes.</p>
					        <p>Once I was happy with the overall flow, hierarchy and content of the screens, I worked with the visual designer to start producing high-fidelity prototypes, whilst also updating the docs with interaction notes and acceptance criteria.</p>
					        <p>These high-fidelity designs would then get tested again in the next round of usability testing sessions and iterated on as per need. I made sure that the headline feedback was in front of the designer by the next morning so that we could iterate quickly. On some occasions, the designer would be with me in the session, so we could iterate in between testing sessions on the big things that we wanted to change, for truly rapid iteration.</p>
					        <p>Having already included the developers in this process, with all the stories and epics written out in collaborative multi-discipline sessions already, it was an easy next step for them to start working on building the designs.</p>
					        <p>My role at this stage was to input and guide the developers as they pushed updates to the testing environment, so I could play around with the interactions and structure actually on screen. Feedback would be given to the developers in collaborative pairing sessions so I could sit with them and work in browser. </p>
					        <p>Finally, once developed, the whole team would help QA the new feature.</p>

					        <h3>The outcome</h3>
					        <p>We worked in this manner on a number of projects, most notably the registration flow for young people and parents, a flow for locking and cancelling your Osper card from within the app and getting sent your PIN from within the app.</p>
					        <p>Working in this agile and collaborative manner was great in making sure that there were no surprises within the development cycle, and that for the most part, projects ran smoothly. It was also fantastic to be running weekly usability testing sessions for up-to-the-minute feedback from users.</p>
