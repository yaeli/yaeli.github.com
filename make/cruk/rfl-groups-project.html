            <span class="label">The Challenge</span>
            <p>Cancer Research run an annual event called Race for Life that is made up of many local races, whose participants run to race money to beat cancer.</p>
            <p>Before 2012, to enter Race for Life, you could only enter as a sole participant or register another participant. There was no ability to be linked to other people and fundraise together as a group.</p>
            <p>Cancer Research wanted to be able to integrate group registration within their current online registration form.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label">What I Did</span>
            <p>I was briefed that the new Groups functionality would have to be included without changing the existing registration process for individuals, given me limited scope as to what I could and could not touch. This was partly due to the fact that the current registration process had been through extensive usability testing and multivariate testing already.</p>
            <p>Evaluating the current registration process, as well as the technical limitations as discussed with the developers on the team, I began working on the user flows for group registration. This encompassed both creating a group and joining a group, and was achieved by mocking up the various flows using Omnigraffle.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Example user flow from the documentation I created</p></span>
            <p>I then moved on to fleshing out the various screens - moving from sketches to wireframes in Omnigraffle. There were a number of considerations:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>How to redesign the landing page so that both individual and group registration were represented</li>
              <li>Furthermore, how to ensure that both people who wanted to createÂ <strong>and join</strong> a group were represented</li>
              <li>What group-specific copy would there need to be? What creator-specific and joiner-specific copy would there need to be?</li>
              <li>How to adjust the current registration form to include group-specific questions where appropriate</li>
              <li>How to improve the Thanks page once registered</li>
              <li>How to accommodate people who abandon registration process</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="proj-outcome">
            <span class="label">The Outcome</span>
            <p>I created full documentation for this project, including user flows and wireframes for all the various scenarios and interactive states, in conjunction with close consultation from the Project Manager, Business Intelligence and Developer teams. I presented the wireframes to the stakeholders of the project, and with full approval, handed over the project ready for the Build phase.</p>
