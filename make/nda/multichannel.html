              <span class="label">Project Brief</span>
              <p>The client had a number of digital initiatives that they wanted to push forward, and they wanted to have some way of stitching them together for their internal stakeholders to showcase the multi-channel experience that their customers would get if these digital initiatives were built.</p>
              <p>We were tasked with coming up with a way to showcase how these digital initiatives could work together to create a seamless customer experience, for presentation internally.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>The banking client had identified a number of digital customer service initiatives that they wanted to build in order to improve their customer’s experience. They also wanted to make sure that these new projects were considered together so that their internal stakeholders could get a sense for how the customers could move between them seamlessly.</p>
            <p>Part of our challenge was to understand how customers could use these, as yet unbuilt, digital initiatives together and another part of the challenge was how to present this back to the client so that they could use it to get internal buy-in. </p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>The first step in this project was to understand what a Multichannel banking strategy truly means. I did desk research into multichannel banking strategies and created a presentation that covered what multichannel is, how customers use different channels, why a multi-channel strategy is important, a roadmap to a multi-channel strategy, business considerations and the future of multi-channel banking.</p> 
            <p>I presented this to the client in order to demonstrate some best-practice multichannel strategies and processes that could inform our work further along.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Strategy deck that I presented to client.</p></span>
            <p>Next, I began to look more in-depth in the proposed digital customer services initiatives that the client was trying to get buy-in for.</p>
            <p>I started pulling out some of their high-level features and benefits for the customer. I also held a series of stakeholder phone interviews with the client to understand where they felt the value of these digital initiatives lay. With all of this information, I started crafting a series of user journeys that weaved together a number of the digital initiatives in the same journey, in order to show off how the customer can experience a seamless journey.</p>

            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>High level user journeys</p></span>
            <p>I presented six user journeys to the client that showcased the different digital initiatives in a variety of settings: from complex customer service queries to proactive customer service initiatives. With some feedback from the client, I started moving the user journeys into customer experience maps. </p>

            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Experience map</p></span>
            <p>I created the customer experience maps in order to show the client how the customer’s needs would be serviced through these new initiatives, what features and benefits they will bring, and what channels each initiative would touch.</p>
            <p>I then started scamping up some of the key screens that each journey was showcasing, in order for the visual designer to work them up into concepts of real screens that could accompany each journey to excite the internal clients.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Scamps of how screens could look</p></span>
            <p>After presenting these back to the client and getting sign-off to proceed, the visual designer started working the scamps into concepted screens. We worked together to produce a PDF that walked through each journey, including a written story and the key screens in high fidelity.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>We presented these to the client and they were well-received. Our PDF deliverable was used by the client to present internally to get buy-in for budget to proceed with the build for these digital initiatives.</p>
