            <p>Anyone with an account on JustGiving has their own account admin area, where they can adjust their account settings, see their donations, see how their fundraising page is performing etc. As a particularly old part of JustGiving, it suffered from having had a lot of the new features and functionality of JustGiving being strapped on.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>The current end user account area on JustGiving</p></span>
            <p>The challenge on this project was to redesign this account area into a far more cohesive and intuitive experience, in order to <strong>make it easier for people to get what they wanted to do accomplished</p>
            <p>I split this broad goal into 2 more specific aims:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Identify and optimise for key tasks in the account area.</li>
              <li>Make the account area smarter to relieve some of the burden on the user. Could the system recognise things about you and adjust the content shown as appropriate?</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>Key tasks were identified by:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Looking at analytics available about how people were using the account.</li>
              <li>Utilising previous research and historical experience about activity in the account admin area. This took into account the many different kinds of account users JustGiving has - people fundraising In Memory of someone, people who use it to check their Direct Debits to charity, fundraisers who want to see their latest page donations etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bound up with this was also talking with the Product Manager about what the business wanted to prioritise as pushing out to our users, as the account admin area is an important Marketing tool. These insights were also taken into consideration.</p>
            <p>I also wanted to make the account admin area smarter. As there are many different variables that potentially make up a JustGiving user, a 'one size fits all' approach would be short-sighted. Whilst there wasn't scope in the project to do anything radical, was there a way for your account area to be optimised for you along particular variables?</p>
            <p>Together with the developers, we identified a number of areas where we would overhaul the area to recognise specific flags and serve up targeted content based on those flags.</p>

            <p>This project was one of the first at JustGiving that was worked on in an agile manner. The entire team, Design, Copy, and Front/Back End developers, worked with me to help me produce sketches outlining the bones of the feature.</p>
            <p>Additionally, with the developers, we agreed on all the different permutations of what would appear for all the combinations of 'user variables'. With Copy, we went through all the different messaging that would now be required for the account admin - going from 'one message for all' to targeted messages was a really important part of making the account admin area a success.</p>

            <p>From these initial conversations and brainstorms together as a team with myself as a facilitator, my sketches and notes we had all taken were enough for us to all feel confident to go straight into developing the product without any further need for more documentation.</p>

          <div class="proj-outcome">
            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>We produced a redesigned account admin area very quickly, within two sprints. </p>
            <a class="lightbox" href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7167/6782028335_60a6c3ef8b_b.jpg" title="End User Account end design - active view"> 
              <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7167/6782028335_60a6c3ef8b_q.jpg" alt="3. sketch2">
            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>End User Account end design - active view</p></span>
            <p>The highlights of the new account area, other than a refreshed visual design were:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>It was much easier for users to find the things they needed quicker. In the previous design, many key pieces of functionality were hidden behind unnecessary screens and confusing copy. The new design presented the important tasks clearly right on the account area homescreen.</li>
              <li>We loaded the new account area with improved Google Analytics tracking, so that we could further investigate and learn even more about how the admin area was being used. This would be crucial information to inform the next iteration of redesign.</li>
              <li>Something that JustGiving and many users felt was lacking from the JG website in general was help from JustGiving to fundraise more effectively. JustGiving prides itself on being a leader in online fundraising and communicates this message to their users through Marketing materials etc. However, JustGiving weren't showcasing this expertise and experience in appropriate places on the website to help people fundraise better. The account admin area was the perfect place to do this. I created a main panel area in the account admin, where JustGiving would be able to highlight features they felt were appropriate and important based on their expertise. For example, from JustGiving's data, we can see that people who share their fundraising page on Facebook generally have higher donation amounts. This is something that can be communicated to users to encourage them to share from within the admin area. Working on the content for this panel was a collaboration between myself, the analytics team and community team in coming up with some of this expert knowledge that we wanted to surface.</li>
              <li>The admin area was much smarter. For example, the area would be able to know whether your page was active, expired or just created,and target appropriate messaging accordingly. This would help not only with the onboarding experience for new users, but throughout the fundraising process. The new area would also 'know' what type of event you were fundraising for - this was massively important in making sure messaging was appropriate - for a JG user who is fundraising in memory of a loved one, content should be different  than for a JG user who is running a marathon for as part of a company team.</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
            <p>This was a very successful project because we not only redesigned the admin area from a more aesthetic point of view and usability-wise, but we also managed to make the feature be smarter in small, but highly effective ways.</p>
            <p>The team's rapid transition from sketches to working onscreen helped us to produce something much more efficiently and collaboratively - this was one of the first times a team at JustGiving had experimented working in this way and the fact that it was also a learning curve for everybody involved, makes the success of the product even better. I really enjoyed the cross discipline pairing and constant communication between various parts of the team, as well as facilitating the different specialities in the team to come up with something together.</p>
            <p>Looking at what didn't go so well, this project was lacking in usability testing afterwards. We developed the new features and due to the nature of our workloads, usability testing didn't happen. We always tried to have usability testing once an iteration (once every two weeks) but sometimes this didn't occur. Building in a stronger routine and focus on testing evaluatively is something that I needed to be better at.</p>
