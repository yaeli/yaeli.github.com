            <span class="label">The Challenge</span>
						<p>As part of the creation of a mobile app for a financial services client, I created a suite of user scenarios in order to:</p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Understand more about our user's goals and how to design appropriate solutions for them.</li>
                <li>As a compelling way to demonstrate to the end-client how the apps will integrate into customer's lives, and the benefits from doing so.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Personas had already been created to represent primary users and were to be used in the creation of the scenarios.</p> </div>
          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label">What I Did</span>
						<p>Key tasks within the mobile app were identified for each of the personas. I then fleshed out some context around these key tasks - why, where, who and what was happening in this scenario. I then documented the steps that each persona would need to take to carry out their task. The steps were all kept relatively high-level at this stage and were first sketched out on paper and then layed out in InDesign. </p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>User Scenarios.</p></span>
            <p>For each scenario, I mapped out the customer journey both for users using the mobile app and for users not using the mobile app. This helped to demonstrate to the end-client the differences in how the customer would be able to achieve their end-goals using the mobile app compared to a world without it.</p>
            <a class="fancybox" href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8145/7507714196_da70609325_b.jpg" title="User Scenario - including both present and future tracks, features and benefits.">

            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>User Scenario - including both present and future tracks, features and benefits.</p></span>
            <p>Underneath each step, I included the key features of the mobile app used in accomplishing that step, how this would benefit the customer, how this would benefit the end-client, and some notes about key considerations and questions that each step brought up.</p>
            <p>I also began to wireframe in low fidelity some of the key screens that the steps addressed using Axure. This was to bring the scenario to life and also to begin visualising the important components of various screens in the context of key tasks.</p>

            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Lo-fi wireframes - Achievement locker</p></span>
            <p>Creating the scenarios was really helpful not only by bringing to life to the end-client how the mobile app would impact the lives and goals of their customers, but also as the first stage in sparking a greater conversation amongst the UX and design team about the further design of the mobile app.</p>

            <span class="label">The Outcome</span>
            <p>The user scenarios were presented to the end-client and revisions made as necessary, and the scenarios and accompanying low fidelity wireframes are now being used to inform further design work and design decisions on the mobile app.</p>
