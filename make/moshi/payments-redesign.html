              <span class="label">Project Brief</span>
              <p>We wanted to <strong>redesign the membership flow</strong>, so that non-members could more <strong>easily convert to paid members</strong>. The current flow was clunky, overly complicated, and took an average of 8 minutes to complete. We wanted to streamline it down as much as possible to create a quick, usable experience that could convert many more members. </p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>The main challenges here were to:</p>
            <ul class="list">
            	<li>Find out what parents wanted to know before they would consider paying for a Moshi membership, and to make sure we answered all these questions within the design.</li>
            	<li>Streamline down a really clunky process so that it was not only usable, but also incredibly quick.</li>
            	<li>Optimise the flow for mobile as much as possible (though this was not an immediate business priority).</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>Before anything, I did a quick competitive analysis of what some of our competitor's payments flows looked like, identifying some common patterns and messaging.</p>            
            <p>I conducted a usability and content review of the current payments flow, identifying many issues for improvement. This involved a heuristic evaluation and usability testing with parents. I presented these findings to the product team and we prioritised the areas that we could focus on in this redesign.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Some of the output from my various reviews</p></span>
            <p>I began sketching the current flow, identifying redundant areas and ways to slim it down. This led to iterating the flow down to the quickest way through. I wireframed various versions of the screens and iterated through these with input from tech and design</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Wireframes</p></span>
            <p>Once we were happy with the basic structure and content, I then put this all together as an interactive prototype in Axure.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Screens from one of the first versions of the prototype</p></span>            
            <p>During this time, we had parents coming in for usability testing every week, testing the prototype and giving feedback. I would iterate on the information and layout constantly after these sessions.</p>

            <p>Once we were comfortable with the general layout and flow, I worked with the visual designer to start coming up with high fidelity screens. I inputted the high fidelity screens into the prototype and carried on testing with parents.  I also collaborated with the tech lead to make sure that the designs were feasible and made sense from a tech perspective.</p>

            <p>We ended up with a rigorously tested payment flow that worked intuitively and that made sense for parents. However, the project was put on hold for business reasons.</p>
