              <span class="label">Project Brief</span>
              <p>In Moshi Monsters, kids are able to visit their ‘Dress-Up Room’ and have their monster try on different clothes. They can then save their outfit to be worn around Monstro City. This feature had not been revisited for many years and had many usability issues that prevented kids from being able to enjoy dressing up as much as possible. The aim was to improve the dress up feature and increase participation for existing users.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>The Dress Up feature in Moshi Monsters had been neglected for many years and this showed in participation rates, which were in much need of improvement. The challenge was to identify what could be achieved in a couple of sprints that would have the greatest impact on participation and enjoyment, and then design and implement these changes. We would look at whether participation in Dress Up increased as a measure of success.</p>

          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>I ran usability testing of the current dress-up functionality, conducting about 6 sessions with kids aged 6-11 to uncover issues. I also did a usability review of the current dress-up to document more issues.</p>
            <p>After consulting with the product manager to find out the business requirements, I compiled a spreadsheet of issues, rated by severity and business needs. Together with the rest of the team, we assessed this list of issues so that we could decide what to commit to in the next 2 upcoming sprints. We focused down on 4 or 5 manageable issues to tackle.</p>
            <p>Together with the developer working on the project, we sketched ideas on how to improve the actual dress-up interactions. Together, we prototyped in code a number of improvements to current dress-up interactions, especially in scaling and dragging items onto your monster. We tested two versions with kids and picked a clear winner to take forward.</p>
            <p>As part of this work, I wireframed an update to the dress-up UI, including updating controls and the IA of the page, and worked with the visual designer to reskin Dress Up Room. Throughout development of the chosen features, I worked closely with everyone to make sure we were on track and to make sure usability testing was being carried out on each new version.</p>

          <div class="proj-outcome">
            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>We conducted usability testing on the newly implemented dress-up changes and observed improvements in:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Understanding what the dress-up room was for</li>
							<li>Ease of use in dragging clothes to monster</li>
							<li>More intuitive understanding of how to manipulate clothing items</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Dress-up participation and purchase of clothing items also increased.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="proj-eval">
            <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
            <p>Some of what we could achieve in two sprints was hampered by the fact that this part of the codebase was rather old. We had to work around these constraints. We also found that we didn’t have the resources to be able to add full eventing into the Dress Up Room feature so we were unable to fully track everything we wanted to. However, we could tell that more kids were changing their outfits and buying more clothes.</p>
            <p>It would have also been nice to address Dressing Up for new users but that was out of the scope of this work. </p>
