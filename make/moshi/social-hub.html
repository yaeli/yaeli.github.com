            <p>The challenge was to create a usable but whimsical new way of messaging on Moshi Monsters, that takes into consideration safety and transparency concerns.</p>

              <p>To message another user on Moshi Monsters, kids are able to post pinboard messages on each other’s pinboards. As a messaging facility, it was pretty old and very limited in functionality.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Screenshots of old messaging system</p></span>
              <p>We wanted to create a new way of messaging that would make it easier for kids to message and reply to their friends, and thereby increase how social kids can be on Moshi.</p> 
              <p>We were tasked with concepting various different ways that messaging could be reinvented on Moshi, and setting out how this work could be done in phases, so that incremental improvements could be made, versus a massive redesign.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>This project began with a brainstorming session with myself, the visual designer and the lead artist. The lead artist then created some amazing concepts for us to play with.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Artist's concepts</p></span>                        
            <p>We presented these to the product manager, and we decided to go in the direction of a steampunk, tubular messaging system.</p>
            <p>I sketched out a new flow that placed more emphasis on:</p>
            <ul class="list">
            	<li>Ability to reply with ease</li>
            	<li>Ability to find new friends to message</li>
            	<li>Ability to send and receive messages from anywhere in-game</li>
            	<li>Consolidating all the different kinds of message that users currently send in-game: text, video, gifts etc</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Moving through to the design phase, I sketched and wireframed some of the main screens, and used these as a springboard into a discussion with the product manager about how we could split this work into slices for development, that would make it more of an incremental change.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Artist's concepts</p></span>             
            <p>Throughout this work, I iterated on the designs with the visual designer and artist to add elements of the steampunk theme we were going for, and began working with the animator to add appropriate animations in.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Iterating on design</p></span>             
            <p>We ended up with the visual designer creating a high fidelity prototype that had the steampunk art elements and animations, which we used to test with the kids. We iterated on this prototype refining as we went along.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>We ended up with a prototype for a first slice of a redesign, and wireframes for second slice. There was no development resource at the point to start full work on this project, so it was put on hold.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
            <p>This was one of the first times that an artist was actually part of the sprint team, rather than passing over art at some point in the process. It was great to collaborate so closely with the artist on artistic direction and ideas. It was also a lot of fun to take apart something very functional and rework it in a way that was more whimsical but still usable.</p>
            <p>Looking at what didn’t go so well, any project that I am not able to shepherd through development is always sad. I like to see a project all the way through to being implemented. However, that was just not possible on this one. </p>
