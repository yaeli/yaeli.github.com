								        <h3>The challenge</h3>
								        <p>To prepare for the summer holidays, we were asked to come up with an aspirational campaign that would encourage both existing and lapsed players to come back to play Moshi again and again during the summer. We wanted to produce a big game-wide event, with a dynamic story that kids would want to see through to completion.</p>	
								        <p>We also wanted it to have a prominent members-only component to encourage players to upgrade to paid membership.</p>

					        <h3>What I did</h3> 
					        <div class="row">
					        		<div class="col-md-8">					        
												<p>The entire Moshi Monsters team had a brainstorming session to come up with ideas for what this could look like. We got out the post-its, and broke out into little groups to come up with ideas. We then came together and went through our favourite ideas as a group. Out of this session, the game designer began constructing the idea of a Giant Beanstalk sprouting up in the Moshi world.</p> 
												<p>My role was to come up with a concrete vision for how this would work in-game, produce user flows and wireframed screens that covered all the elements of the Beanstalk campaign, and then work with the team to build it.</p>
												<p>The discovery phase of this project had to be done in a very short amount of time. I iterated rapidly through a number of various ways that we could tackle the beanstalk through our existing UIs, before presenting 3 different ideas to the rest of the team. In a working session, we ended up creating a hybrid of all three ideas, that worked best within our time, design and engineering constraints and with the game mechanics.</p>

												<p>Importantly, I also created a collaboration workspace that was used to keep the core team up to date with the objectives of what we were building, and the latest flows, screens, sketches and drawings so that the entire team could see what we were doing. </p>
												<p>Whilst we were firming up the flows, the visual designer and artists started work on the visual language and assets. Based on my omnigraffle flows and initial screens, we worked with the tech lead create basic working prototypes of the game, to test various types of interaction.</p>
												<p>Especially challenging was the idea of having a progress bar that unlocked in-game content and was date-locked. There were a number of different ways that we could implement it, so I worked with the designer to make a number of prototypes which we tested with children and internally to see what felt the best. Utilising our weekly testing sessions with children, a clear winner was found that made it the most clear what content was unlocked when.</p>

					        <h3>The outcome</h3>
					        <p>We worked in this manner on a number of projects, most notably the registration flow for young people and parents, a flow for locking and cancelling your Osper card from within the app and getting sent your PIN from within the app.</p>
					        <p>Working in this agile and collaborative manner was great in making sure that there were no surprises within the development cycle, and that for the most part, projects ran smoothly.</p>
					        <p>It was also fantastic to be running weekly usability testing sessions for up-to-the-minute feedback from users and putting a structure in place that allowed the startup to continue with this after I'd gone.</p>
