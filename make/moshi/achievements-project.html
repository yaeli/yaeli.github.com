            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>The question of how to better guide our first time players in the Moshi Monsters world was brought into sharp focus with my creation of a 'first time experience' map, which I'd made following some low figures being found for the engagement analytics for our new users.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>The first time experience map</p></span>
            <p>Looking at the map, it was obvious that a complete lack of guidance at the very beginning of the Moshi journey was something that needed to be addressed, as we hypothesised that it was affecting the return rate of our players.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>Using the experience map as a guide, I identified the major pain points for first time users upon their first session of gameplay in Moshi.</p>

            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>A snapshot of a major pain point in the onboarding experience of new users.</p></span>
            <p>It was clear that a recurring theme within the pain points was that they could all be alleviated by giving first time users clearer instructions as to their first steps within the game.</p>
            <p>So, prioritising the top 5 pain points, I assigned each pain point with a 'task' that would explain to the player about what they had to do and give tips as to how they could do it. Once completed, each task would unlock an achievement of some kind.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Early sketches of ideas for the registration flow</p></span>
            <p>Sketching out flows of how tasks could work in-game, I played with the idea of building into the game a system of these 'tasks' that would trigger at various points during gameplay, telling the player that they needed to do something. These tasks would not only give a bit of structure to the game by introducing the players to a variety of features, but could also give the player some help in completing it, thereby reducing a lot of the obstacles that first time players may face. I rejigged the experience map to reflect how the experience could be improved with the introduction of tasks.</p>

            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Rejigged experience map</p></span>
            <p>Looking at incentivising the players to complete these task, the more traditional game mechanic of 'achievements', ("You've reached Level 10!"), seemed a natural fit with tasks - completing the room decoration task would unlock the 'Monster Decorator' badge etc. A bit of competitive analysis had revealed that achievements were a major player and were even married up to tasks in some cases, like in Pet Society. But, it was clear that too much intervention into the order of tasks/achievements could seem formulaic and prescriptive.</p>
            <p>Collaborating heavily with the designer on my team, we came up with a variety of initial concepts of how tasks/achievements could work in-game. We sketched up and then loosely wireframed a variety of different options - looking at how tasks/achievements could be alerted to the user during gameplay, how completion of tasks/achievements could be recorded, how upcoming tasks/achievements could be shown, and what the tasks/achievements themselves would look like. I also worked on some flows for how the initial tasks/achievements we had chosen would be triggered.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>Presenting our initial ideas to the rest of the dev team, it became quickly clear that we would need to rethink some of our ideas. Whilst we were given quite a loose brief to come up with some initial concepts for improving the first time experience using 'achievements', the dev team quickly informed us that our use of both tasks and achievements was not something the system could cope with at this present time.</p>
            <p>We took many elements of our ideas and designs, and went back to the drawing board as a team, fusing together tasks and achievements. This meant that instead of having a task pop up, the user going to do it, and then an achievement related to that task appearing, instead we would have automatic achievements with hints towards how to unlock the next achievement ("You've unlocked the Monster Owner badge! Why not go decorate your room?"). This made it simpler tech-wise and also went someway to adding more guided help to the first time play experience, even if it was much more subtle than first envisioned.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
            <p>The team responded excellently to having to pivot and scale back on our initial ideas. We sat down and created a story map together which really helped to get everybody on the same page and re-align expectations and understanding.</p>
            <p>However, there was a fundamental lack of communication between myself/design and the dev team when we were coming up with initial concepts. Checking in with the dev team more about our various ideas would have meant that we could have reached our compromise state much quicker.</p>
