            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>As a growing business without any UX resource, Mind Candy wanted to better understand some of the usability challenges and issues faced in their children's game, <a href="http://moshimonsters.com" target="_blank">Moshi Monsters</a>. I was brought in to conduct a site-wide usability review and to document and present to the internal product team the key usability issues within the game.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>It was impossible in the timeframe to fully review all aspects of the site. Therefore, my first job was to identify the key processes, areas and tasks within the game so I could prioritise specific areas for my report. The key areas that I focused on were:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>The Homepage</li>
              <li>Creating an Account</li>
              <li>Becoming a Member</li>
              <li>The HUD</li>
              <li>Important areas in Gameplay, like your monster's room and parts of the monster's world.</li>
              <li>The Community areas like the Forum and the Blog</li>
            </ul>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Example slides from the report</p></span>
            <p>Using common usability heuristics, I analysed and played through the game evaluating its functionality and experience as I went. For each issue, I clearly stated the issue, the positive points and the problem areas, and my recommendations to fix it. I also used plenty of screenshots to illustrate my report.</p>

            <p>It also became clear that there were some issues that weren't specific to a particular area of gameplay and were more global, for example, navigation issues and unclear copy. For these 'big issues', I dedicated a specific section of my report to talk more in depth about them and included examples from all over gameplay, as well as recommendations for improvements.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>I put together a detailed report talking through my findings for the internal teams to read and digest in their own time.</p>
            <a class="lightbox" href="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5240/6999413842_20d95dbfe7_o.png" title="Example slides from the report">

            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Example slides from the report</p></span>
            <p>I also put together a briefer presentation that touched on the main points of my findings, and I presented this to about a dozen members of the internal team as well as the CEO. My presentation and report were well received and it was great to hear how useful it was for the teams to have many of the UX and usability problems that had been plaguing the teams in one place with actionable recommendations.</p>
