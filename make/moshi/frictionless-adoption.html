              <p>We were interested to look at ways to streamline the Moshi registration process. My role was to conceptualise and design how this new flow would work, communicate it to all the various teams and work with each to bring it to life.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>The aim of this registration redesign was to increase the amount of people that completed registration and got into the game.</p>
            <p>By studying analytics, user research and also by observing many failed registrations in usability testing, we understood that the greatest blocker to registration was asking for an email address.</p>
            <p>There were two main reasons for this:</p>
            <ul class="list">
            	<li>We are asking children to sign up. Kids often donâ€™t have their own email address, have to ask a parent for their address, or even resort to just filling this field out with junk.</li>
            	<li>We were making users activate their email address by going to their inbox, waiting for the email to appear, and then clicking on the link in the email. This was a major blocker for many kids who are mostly expecting to just play the game straight away. There were comprehension issues about what they needed to do, and also access issues. Many had to wait for a parent to access email or couldn't actually access the email because they gave us a fake address.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project was a big challenge as it would involve many different parts of Moshi Monsters and therefore many different teams. Keeping this in mind, I had to consider:</p>
            <ul class="list">
            	<li>Designing a new flow that takes into account business needs, user needs and the technical and time constraints of working with many different teams all at once</li>
            	<li> Effectively communicating the new flow and changes to the various teams and make sure that everybody was on the same page </li>
            	<li>Guiding development of the new feature and be the linchpin of knowledge across teams.</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>First up was reviewing the business requirements with various business stakeholders, making sure our business objectives and constraints were clear.</p>
            <p>I also comducted a usability review of the current registration process to see what (if any) UX changes we could sneak in along the way.</p>
						<p>Once I was clear on all the requirements, I began sketching the new flow. This went through a few iterations as there were lots of teams and people who needed to input on feasibility.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Proposed flow iteration</p></span>
						<p>I ended up presenting two different flows to the team, as the business was unsure about a key point, so to cover all the bases, I worked up two variations for them.</p>
						<p>Once the business had decided on their final choice, I delivered a final flow and some initial wireframed screens to the team. At this point my involvement on the project ended.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>The greatest challenge of this redesign was that the project touched so many different parts of Moshi Monsters, that every decision had to be cross-checked with a vast number of people, and there were more than the usual number of constraints on what would be achievable. </p>
            <p>After much iteration and wrangling, I was able to come up with a solution that fit the business and technical needs.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
            <p>As mentioned, the main difficulty in this project came from its size and complexity. I had to work hard to ensure that my documentation and presentations were easily accessible and understood by everybody, as well as coordinating feedback and buy-in from the various teams too.</p>
            <p>However, I consider this a success as by the end, I had a clear vision for what we were going to achieve that was well understood by everyone involved.</p>
