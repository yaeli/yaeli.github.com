              <span class="label">Project Brief</span>
              <p>We were interested in looking at ways to streamline our registration process and Frictionless Adoption was our term for “You don’t need to give us your email address to start playing Moshi Monsters”. My role was to conceptualise and design how this new flow would work, communicate it to all the various teams and work with each to bring it to life.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>The aim of this registration redesign was to increase the amount of people that completed registration and got into the game, by removing the main blocker to registration - having to provide their email address. Providing an email address was the cause of our 2 biggest drop-off points:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Having to give an email address to us (kids often don’t have their own email address, have to ask a parent, or even resort to just filling this field out with junk)</li>
            	<li>Having to activate the email address by waiting for the email, and clicking on the link in your inbox (this is a major blocker for most kids, as firstly, they are expecting to just play the game straight away, and then also many need to wait for a parent to access email or cannot actually access an inbox due to giving us a fake address).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project was a huge undertaking, as this project would involve many different touchpoints on Moshi Monsters and therefore many different teams. The main challenges were:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>To design a new flow that takes into the business needs, user needs and the technical and time constraints of working with many different teams all at once</li>
            	<li> To effectively communicate the new flow and changes to the various teams and make sure that everybody was on the same page </li>
            	<li>To guide development of the new feature and be the linchpin of knowledge across teams.</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>Reviewed biz requirements with stakeholders. Usability review of current registration process to see what (if any) UX changes we could sneak in along the way. Sketched new flow and went through it with tech and design leads of various teams to discuss feasibility - iterated here a bunch of times. Presented a final flow and screens to team. Development began!</p>

          <div class="proj-outcome">
            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>The challenge of this redesign touching so many different touchpoints across Moshi Monsters meant that this project had a lot of various constraints on what would be achievable. </p>
            <p>After much iteration, I was able to come up with a solution that fit the business and technical needs. I presented the final flow and screens to the product team and tech/design leads and kicked off development.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
            <p>The main difficulty in this project came from its size and complexity, due to the amount of different stakeholders and teams it touched. I had to work hard to ensure that my documentation and presentations were easily accessible and understood by everybody, as well as coordinating feedback and buy-in from the teams too.</p>
