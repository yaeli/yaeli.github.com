              <span class="label">Project Brief</span>
              <p>To prepare for the summer holidays, we were asked to come up with an <strong>aspirational campaign</strong> that would encourage both existing and lapsed players to come back to play Moshi again and again during the summer. We wanted to produce a <strong>big game-wide event</strong>, with a dynamic story that kids would want to see through to completion, and of course, <strong>improve our membership conversion rate</strong>.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>We wanted to create a compelling story and in-game event for our players, that would be fun to play and give them a reason to return again and again across the summer holidays. We also wanted it to have a prominent members-only component to encourage players to upgrade to paid membership.</p>
            <p>The entire Moshi Monsters team had a brainstorming session to come up with ideas for what this could look like. We got out the post-its, and broke out into little groups to come up with ideas. We then came together and went through our favourite ideas as a group. Out of this session, the game designer began constructing the idea of a Giant Beanstalk sprouting up in the Moshi world.</p> 
            <p>This would incorporate a storyline expanding existing Moshi lore about why the beanstalk was there, it would include various levels with different activities for the kids to do, and it would also encourage kids to keep returning through various mechanisms.</p>
            <p>My role was to come up with a concrete vision for how this would work in-game, produce user flows and wireframed screens that covered all the elements of the Beanstalk campaign, and then work with the team to build it.</p>

          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>Firstly, I worked with the game designer to understand the overall vision and game mechanics for how this in-game event would work.</p>
            <a class="fancybox" href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7374/11355495236_f8662fc4c9_c.jpg"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7374/11355495236_f8662fc4c9_q.jpg" alt="Game design docs" /></a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Initial game design docs created by game designer</p></span>
            <p>The discovery phase of this project had to be done in a very short amount of time. I iterated rapidly through a number of various ways that we could tackle the beanstalk through our existing UIs, before presenting 3 different ideas to the rest of the team. In a working session, we ended up creating a hybrid of all three ideas, that worked best within our time, design and engineering constraints and with the game mechanics.</p>
            <a class="fancybox" href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3728/11355634064_955375316f_c.jpg"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3728/11355634064_955375316f_q.jpg" alt="Initial sketches" /></a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Sketching through various ideas</p></span>
            <p>Importantly, I also created a collaboration workspace that was used to keep the core team up to date with the objectives of what we were building, and the latest flows, screens, sketches and drawings so that the entire team could see what we were doing. </p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Working on the flows</p></span>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Initial wireframes used as discussion points with the rest of the team.x	</p></span>
            <p>Whilst we were firming up the flows, the visual designer and artists started work on the visual language and assets. Based on my omnigraffle flows and initial screens, we worked with the tech lead create basic working prototypes of the game, to test various types of interaction.</p>

            <p>Especially challenging was the idea of having a progress bar that unlocked in-game content and was date-locked. There were a number of different ways that we could implement it, so I worked with the designer to make a number of prototypes which we tested with children and internally to see what felt the best. Utilising our weekly testing sessions with children, a clear winner was found that made it the most clear what content was unlocked when.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>Within 4 weeks, we created the biggest and best in-game event that Moshi Monsters had ever seen, on an unprecedented scale. This included not only adding the in-game event, but also adding supporting assets and membership upsells throughout the game, a homepage takeover and marketing assets. </p>

            <p>Early indications suggested that we had increased membership conversions, retention and new sign-ups during the weeks that the campaign was running.</p>

          <div class="proj-eval">
            <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
            <p>One of the main challenges was having very little time to implement this event, resulting in not much room for change. We playtested and usability tested throughout the sprints, but we were not always able to address every issue that we wanted to.</p>
            <p>Another challenge was that halfway through development, it was decided that a much heavier focus on upselling non-members to paid membership was needed. We had to work in changes to the flows that blocked off more things for non-members, and added in more opportunities for them to upgrade.</p>
            <p>In terms of what went well, the team worked incredibly well together. Because of the very short duration of the development work, everybody had to start work at the same time and in conjunction, which could have resulted in some much greater problems had the communication within the team not been so incredible. The collaborative workspace area that kept the team up to date was invaluable in making sure everybody was on the same page.</p>
