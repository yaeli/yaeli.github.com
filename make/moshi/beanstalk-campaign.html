              <span class="label">Project Brief</span>
              <p>To prepare for the summer holidays, we were asked to come up with an aspirational campaign for existing and lapsed players to get them excited about Moshi Monsters and coming back to play again and again during the summer. Some key things that the business wanted to produce was a big game-wide event, a dynamic story that kids will want to see through to completion, and of course, improve our membership conversion rate.</p>

            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>We wanted to create a compelling story and in-game event for our players, that would be fun to play and give them a reason to return again and again across the summer holidays. We also wanted it to have a prominent members-only component to encourage players to upgrade to paid membership.</p>
            <p>The entire Moshi Monsters team had a brainstorming session together with senior management to come up with various ideas for what this summer campaign would look like. Out of this, the game designer began constructing the idea of a Giant Beanstalk sprouting up in the world. This would incorporate a storyline expanding existing Moshi lore about why the beanstalk was there, it would have various different levels with different activities for the kids to do, and it would also encourage kids to keep returning through various mechanisms.</p>
            <p>My role was to come up with a concrete vision for how this would work in-game and produce flows and screens to get buy-in from the team, and then work with the team to build it.</p>

          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>Firstly, I worked with the game designer to understand the overall vision and mechanism for how this in-game event would work.</p>
            <p>The discovery phase of the project had to be done in a very short amount of time. I iterated rapidly through various flows before presenting 3 different ideas to the rest of the team. We ended up with something that was a combination of all three, that worked best within our time constraints and with the game mechanisms. I also created a collaboration doc that was used to keep the core team up to date with the flows and screens. This complemented the wall space for the Beanstalk team that I created, including all appropriate documents, sketches, drawings so that the entire team could see what we were doing. </p>
            <p>Whilst we were firming up the flows, visual designer and artists started work on the visual language and assets. Based on my omnigraffle flows and initial screens, worked with the visual designer and tech lead to create a basic working prototype of the game, to test various types of interaction. Especially challenging was the idea of having a progress bar that unlocked in-game content and was date-locked. There were a number of different ways that we could implement it, so we made a number of prototypes which we tested with children and internally to see what felt the best.</p>

          <div class="proj-outcome">
            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>Within 4 weeks, we created the biggest and best in-game event that Moshi Monsters had ever seen, on an unprecedented scale. This included not only adding the in-game event, but also adding supporting assets and membership upsells throughout the game, a homepage takeover and marketing assets. </p>
            <p>Early indications suggested that we had increased membership conversions, retention and new sign-ups during the weeks that the campaign was running.</p>

          <div class="proj-eval">
            <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
            <p>One of the main challenges was that we had very little time to implement this event so there was very little room for too much change. We play tested and usability tested throughout the sprints but we were not always able to address every issue that we wanted to.</p>
            <p>Another challenge was that halfway through development, the business decided that we needed a much heavier focus on upselling non-members to paid membership as part of this event. We had to work in some changes to the flows that blocked off more things for non-members, and add in more and heavier opportunities for them to upgrade.</p>
            <p>In terms of what went well, the team worked incredibly well together. Because of the very short duration of the development work, everybody had to start work at the same time and in conjunction, which could have resulted in some much greater problems had the communication within the team not been so incredible.</p>
