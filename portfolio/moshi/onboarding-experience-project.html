            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>Moshi Monsters is a highly successful children's online game with over 50 million users. However, we had identified through our analytics that the percentage of new players that actually returned to the site once they had logged in for the first time could be vastly improved.</p>
            <p>Looking at reasons for why this might be, it was clear that the onboarding experience for new users into the Moshi Monsters world could benefit from some important changes.</p>
            <p>As with much of what we developed at Mind Candy, we were looking for small, incremental improvements that we could put into place within a sprint, that we could then see whether it had a measurable effect or not.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>First up was picking some 'easy wins' in the way we eased new players into the Moshi Monsters world. To do so, I had created a map of the current onboarding experience and highlighted current pain points on the map within the onboarding experience. These pain points were based on a mixture of my expertise and from observing many first time users in usability testing sessions at Mind Candy.</p>

            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>The first time experience map</p></span>
            <p>I debuted the experience map to the team so that we could decide on which pain points we wanted to focus on - the chosen pain points would need to be things that we could fix almost immediately and that we thought would contribute to a measurable impact on the return rate of new users.</p>
            <p>We chose to improve;</p>

              <li>Improve the 'first time user' messages that popped up when a new user went to a new location</li>
              <li>Introduce custom cursors in-game so that users would better understand how to interact with their environment and the items within it</li>
            </ul>

            </a>
            <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Prototype of how custom cursors could work ingame</p></span>
            <p>After identifying these key areas to improve, and hypothesising the effect we hoped it would have on the engagement rate of new players, together with Design, we began working on:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Basic sketches for improvements</li>
              <li>High fidelity wireframes to work on as reference with the front-end developers</li>
              <li>Working prototypes for usability testing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As we moved very quickly as a team, I worked concurrently with design and the front end devs to start implementing our wireframes into the game whilst conducting usability testing sessions. This meant I could run a number of sessions with working prototypes in a staging environment, and that learnings could be fed back into the feature almost immediately.</p>
            <p>The usability testing sessions showed a marked improvement in the wayfinding and navigation of these new players compared to other sessions with the old functionality.</p>
            <p>The team developed these onboarding tweaks relatively quickly using this iterative process.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="proj-outcome">
            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>After releasing these changes into the game, we began to track whether more new users returned to Moshi Monsters in their first week than with the previous functionality. Whilst we couldn't measure precisely whether children were finding their way better or being less confused about what things were in-game, we would be able to tell whether engagement was higher because their first time experience had been less confusing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="proj-eval">
            <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
            <p>The fast paced usability testing on working prototypes that were being developed at the same time worked very well. It was great for the team to know that their current work was on track as well as being able to understand immediately why some things weren't working. I found that it was frequently a lot easier to justify a change or my position with fresh usability testing evidence and that the team got behind making changes much more readily. Whilst it could get particularly hectic, especially because I was the person in charge of coordinating, recruiting for, conducting and evaluating the sessions, it was definitely worth it to be able to quickly iterate on a prototype through different usability testing sessions.</p>
            <p>Thinking on what didn't go so well, tracking the changes that you've implemented is an incredibly important part of the process. When you have got the ability to track your changes, there is almost no excuse. In this case, we were looking for a measurable impact on the return rate of new players. However, I can't say with confidence that we did this. In the immediate aftermath of a release, I didn't ask for any figures because there won't be any measurable change right there and then. Then, a new project comes along, and you get swept up in that, and it is easy to forget about what you were just working on. In this case, I have nothing noted down anywhere where it tells me whether we impacted the return rate of new users. So, I'm not sure if we did or not - all I know is that I didn't make it a priority to find out. This is bad practice - I learnt from this experience the importance of following up on your work and finding out whether it had any impact at all.</p>
