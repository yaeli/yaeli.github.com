                <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
                <p>Moshi Monsters is a staggeringly successful online children's game. It has over 50 million registered users all across the world, with a target market of children between 7-13. The premise of the game is that you adopt your own pet monster, enter the world of Monstro City and play games, solve puzzles and make friends.</p>
                <p>A business need was identified to address the 'adoption rate' - how many people were going through the multi-step process of adopting a monster. Analytics showed that at each stage of the process, there was a significant drop-off rate.</p>
                <p>The challenge for me was to improve this 'adoption process' so that more people actually completed their registration to Mind Candy.</p>

              <div class="proj-actual">
                <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
                <p>I began by evaluating the existing adoption (registration) process. There were a number of steps, and at each step there was significant drop-off. I identified some key problem areas where it was clear that drop-offs were being impacting.</p>
                <p>I then created some sketches to illustrate to the rest of the team what could be changed. This involved redesigning some key pages, including the initial registration form, as well as removing steps from the process. One of the biggest changes was removing a long animated sequence where you are taking through a question and answer session with your monster and finding other points in which to get that information instead.</p>

                <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Early sketches of ideas for the registration flow</p></span>
                <p>I had initially designed a few different ideas for a new adoption process. Together with the team, we picked these apart, and then I began some initial usability testing using prototypes created by myself and Design. We went through several iterations of a new adoption process, revisiting based on these usability tests I conducted on various prototypes.</p>

                <span class="portfolio-img"><p>Lo-fi wireframes for testing</p></span>
                <p>We also created an interactive tutorial for new users. I mapped out the flow of the tutorial, the 'lessons' and how the user would need to interact with the tutorial monster. This tutorial was put through its paces in usability testing as well and went through several iterations to make it more compact and to make it more useful.</p>

                <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
                <p>After thorough usability testing, I chose a final version to go forward with. This final version was a redesign of the adoption process that included redesigned key pages, some removed pages, and a couple of completely new elements. It was a mishmash of lot of bits that we had usability-tested over the 2 weeks previously.</p>

                <p>I worked together with Design, front end and back end developers extremely closely to ensure that the new adoption process was seamless - as well as liaising heavily with Analytics to keep a firm eye on our new adoption rates and drop-offs.</p>

                <span class="portfolio-img"><p>The new form to replace the latter stage of registration.</p></span>
                <p>We released the new Adoption process in stages as little bits were complete. Once we had released the entirety, the adoption rate skyrocketed from 36% to 50% (the highest adoption rate in 2 years).</p>

              <div class="proj-eval">
                <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
                <p>This was a really successful redesign, resulting in a clear measurable impact almost immediately. This was also successful because we had tested a lot of different variations and ideas, which had resulted in us confidently being able to see that we were improving iteratively. I also got a lot of buy in from the team about my ideas and the direction I wanted us to go in because of the constant testing and feedback I was providing.</p>
                <p>Things that didn't go well were that we weren't able to tackle everything that we wanted to. Looking at the registration confirmation emails that were sent with registration were initially part of this story, and I felt that this was really important - particularly because you cannot register without clicking in a confirmation email. I felt that the emails should be seen as an integral part of the adoption process but because of technical difficulties, we weren't able to address them, despite myself and Design having done the initial work to improve them. Our work was benched - sometimes, it is tough to know that a lot of the things that you work hard on might never actually make it to Production.</p>
