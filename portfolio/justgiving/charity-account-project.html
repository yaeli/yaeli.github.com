            <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
            <p>The Charity Adminstration area of JustGiving was in desperate need of a refresh - in terms of visual style, functionality and usability. Years of 'bolting on' sections had made the experience of using the charity administration area disjointed, unfriendly and a chore. JustGiving hired me as a freelance UX designer to review the area, make recommendations for improvement and present this to the JustGiving charity team.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="proj-actual">
            <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
            <p>I began by reviewing the current charity administration area against common usability heuristics and documenting problem areas. I also spoke with the JustGiving internal charity team and charity project manager to identify internal knowledge about issues, as well as to identify key tasks and processes within the charity account area that would require immediate and prioritised attention.</p>
            <p>This was augmented by visiting a number of charities to speak with them about their experiences using the charity area, and their wider needs and goals in terms of what they really wanted to be able to do in their JustGiving admin area. I also ran some usability testing sessions looking at how they performed against the key processes and tasks in the admin area.</p>

          <div class="proj-outcome">
            <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
            <p>From these external sessions, internal sessions and my own usability review, a clear picture began to emerge of the key problems and areas for improvement. I created a short report with my findings and recommendations for improvement, as well as producing wireframes using Axure in the main areas to illustrate how improvements could be made. I presented these to internal stakeholders at JustGiving for further review.</p>

            <p>Some of the key problem areas that I highlighted in my report were:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Unclear navigational structure and confusing taxonomy</li>
              <li>Redundant and/or unclear copy</li>
              <li>Poorly defined types of charity users that would be using this area and accompanying tasks/areas</li>
              <li>Bugs in the system</li>
              <li>Missing functionality most requested by charity users</li>
              <li>Unnecessary functionality</li>
            </ul>
