                <span class="label label-inverse">The Challenge</span>
                <p>Every time you sponsor somebody on JustGiving, you go through what is known as the 'sponsorship process'.</p>
                <p>This involves paying your sponsorship, leaving a message on the fundraising page you've just sponsored, and getting thank you's from the fundraiser and charity. Adding a social component to this process was something that was felt to be crucial; we had conducted much user research which had indicated that people were happy to share causes out to 'get the word out' but not anything about the specifics of their specific donation.  My role was to design a way to incorporate social sharing into the sponsorship process that was seamless, seemed appropriate, and completely optional.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="proj-actual">
                <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
                <p>The first step was to gather up all the learnings from internal user research about sponsorship behaviours. We had learnt from our research that people, whilst they didn't want to talk about how much they gave under any circumstances, were very happy to advertise good causes that they cared about, or the fact that their friends were doing great things for charity.This work informed a lot of our choices regarding messaging and default copy within the social sharing posts.</p>
                <p>As the capabilities and options for integrating with social media are often shifting, it was really important to collaborate heavily with the back end devs to figure out how the best way we could marry up likely sponsorship sharing behaviours with how the various social mediums could integrate with our software. These discussions were crucial for setting expectations about what we could and couldn't do with Facebook and Twitter and made sure that the team were all on the same page about what was possible going forward.</p>
                <p>I was also limited in that anything we introduced could not interfere too heavily with how the current sponsorship process worked.</p>

                <span class="portfolio-img"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/7275152048_72503f3f9a_o.png" width="525" height="531" alt="2. sketch 2"><p>Exploration sketches of incorporating social sharing into an existing flow.</p></span>
                <p>I concepted out various flows that incorporated social sharing into the existing process. This looked at the best place to introduce social sharing, to how this worked with existing elements like the thank you messages from the fundraiser and the charity, and also how best to allow the sponsors to go and share out but still come back to the sponsorship process and complete their journey on our site.</p>
                <span class="portfolio-img"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7071/7275152222_60d1695c6a_o.png" width="525" height="692" alt="3. flows"><p>User flow sketches for the new process.</p></span>
                <p>I decided to re-use a pattern that we had elsewhere on the site with great success for the sponsorship process. I also was lucky enough to be able to iron out some other usability problems while we were already looking at the sponsorship process. I had been through the existing process with our Customer Service team and so I knew what issues we received a lot of calls about. Things like making the 'Sponsor anonymously' option clearer were all small tweaks that I made in the process of adding social sharing that added a lot of value.</p>

                <p>From my initial low fidelity wireframes, I facilitated a conversation between the rest of the team (design, copy, front end and back end developers) to create a higher fidelity idea together of what we were going to produce. We found that for us as a team, the most efficient way to go forward from this point was to treat what was being produced on the screen as our final wireframe.</p>

                <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
                <p>We ended up not only revamping the sponsorship process by adding social sharing, but improving the existing process too. I was clear from the start that it would be foolish to just bolt on social sharing - it needed to be seamless and work well together with all the other existing components of the process. After releasing social sponsorship, we tracked the increase in social sharing from JustGiving.</p>

                <p>I took our finished product through evaluative usability testing towards the end of the iteration and fed back learnings for further iterations on the process.</p>

                <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
                <p>This was a very enjoyable project as the team worked really well together - lots of communication and little documentation. Working in an agile manner with a great team is very rewarding. We also got to improve some little things along the way that were outside the original intent of the project which is always great!</p>
