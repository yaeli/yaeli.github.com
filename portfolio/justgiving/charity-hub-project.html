                <p>Every charity on JustGiving has their very own JustGiving landing page. This landing page is the charity's shop window on JustGiving - the place where a prospective fundraiser will get directed to when they search for your charity, or the place a prospective sponsor will come when they click on the charity name on a fundraising page for more information. Barring leaving JustGiving and googling for more information, there is no other place that fundraisers, sponsors and donors can find out about the charity that they are interested in on JustGiving. This isn't so much of a problem for fundraisers, because they will often have researched their chosen charity extensively and only come to JustGiving after they've committed to a decision. But, in the case of potential sponsors and donors, these pages are crucial for the charities in terms of getting their messaging right, encouraging donations and captivating their audience..</p>
                <span class="portfolio-img"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8157/7274106350_36ec1523f9_o.png" width="525" height="586" alt="1. Charity Hub - Current landing page"><p>The current charity profile page on JustGiving</p></span>
                <p>Unfortunately, these charity pages are somewhat a neglected part of the JustGiving website. They have basic functionality, offer no branding customisation, and don't allow the charities to really catch and captivate their audience.</p>
                <p>A redesign was therefore proposed for these charity pages.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="proj-actual">
                <span class="label label-inverse">What I Did</span>
                <p>This project began with myself conducting a series of user and stakeholder interviews to understand frustrations and shortcomings of what we were currently offering, as well as requirements for what these new charity profile pages would be, from both a user and business perspective.</p>
                <span class="portfolio-img"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7085/7274105972_27a078e92b_o.png" width="525" height="318" alt="2. Charity Hub - Research 1"><p>A consolidation of insights from charity interviews.</p></span>
                <p>Stakeholder interviews involved sitting down at length with the Charity Project Manager to draw out what the business saw as important and why, as well as utilising his knowledge of the charity space to understand more in that respect. I conducted user interviews in three rounds:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li>Phone Interviews with a number of charities, talking to the person who would be involved in the marketing strategy and decision making about the charity's presence on JustGiving. This was to get a sense about the charities' needs and wants, and the reasons for those needs and wants, in a broad sense, so I could get a handle on what new functionality should be introduced to the pages. We also spoke about current frustrations with the limitations of the existing charity pages.</li>
                  <li>Face to face interviews with a number of charities, talking to the person who would be involved in creating, maintaining and updating these pages on JustGiving. I also spoke to a number of fundraisers, donors and sponsors who would be using these pages. These interviews were conducted to both get a secondary viewpoint on the questions above, but was also used as an opportunity to run through some early stage sketches and basic wireframes as I began to consolidate ideas and refine them, to see how well they served wants and needs. I used a series of lo-fi wireframes as talking points in progressive rounds of user interviews and began to see common themes, frustrations and opportunities that formed the basis of the redesign. At this point, I went back to the Project Manager and presented my findings - we did a basic prioritisation exercise to distil down much of functionality, and a basic feature set was created.</li>
                </ul>
                <span class="portfolio-img"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7102/7274106186_f6e1cfb54d_o.png" width="525" height="968" alt="3. Charity Hub - About Us Admin"><p>Lo-fi wireframe of charity profile administration area</p></span>

                <ul class="list">
                  <li>A final round was conducted using higher fidelity wireframe that, together with Design, we had begun to flesh out. Again, this involved a number of face to face sessions with both charity users and fundraisers/sponsors/donors. These sessions were less user research and more usability testing - walking through common tasks with paper prototypes and static wireframes onscreen to iron out any usability problems.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="proj-outcome">
                <span class="label label-inverse">The Outcome</span>
                <p>Informed by these rounds, I worked very closely with Design to produce some high fidelity wireframes. These were presented to business stakeholders and developers to discuss how the redesign could be best sliced into achievable chunks for development work.</p>
                <span class="portfolio-img"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7220/7274106684_a273198c42_o.png" width="525" height="847" alt="5. Charity Hub Hi-Fi Wireframe About Us"><p>Hi-fi wireframe of the end design of the new charity profile pages</p></span>

                <p>Unfortunately, our work was put on hold due to a restructure in the internal teams which meant that there was no available developers to work on this project.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="proj-eval">
                <span class="label label-inverse">Thoughts on What Went Well and What Didn't</span>
                <p>I am proud of the research work that went into that project. The flip side of working in Agile teams is that it is rare (or so I have found) to get the opportunity to research as thoroughly as I did on this project.</p>
                <p>However, together with design, we spent a lot of time on the research and up front design work for this project that didn't see the light of day because of lack of developer resource and shifting priorities. Looking back, and having the experience I've had now in Agile teams, I could have pushed for much less upfront work from myself and design, and spent some quality time with the Project Manager and dev teams at the start deciding how best to slice this work into much smaller, achievable chunks. This would've meant that we would have seen some real progress very quickly and even though it wouldn't have been a fully featured redesign, there would have at least been improvement.</p>
