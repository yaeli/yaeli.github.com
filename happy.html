                  <p>Her regular playtesting sessions have been instrumental in finding out what works and more importantly, what doesn't work, when developing new features.</p>

                  <p>A talent for engaging people works with users too, giving her the empathy necessary for great user research. Yaël combines this with a strong instinct for design and usability, and a very collaborative approach to work.</p>

Delivering a single solution misses the point of a user centred approach to design, but Yaël explores the problem space well and always presents a variety of valuable solutions.</p>
