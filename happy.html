                  <p>Her work is exemplary and extremely comprehensive. However her talents go beyond the boundaries of UX. She is extremely good with clients, particularly at explaining how the work has been derived. She also has a good sense of the project and it's goals so, although immersed in the project, she works to ensure that it is on track both for milestones and objectives. </p>
